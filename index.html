			<p class="introText">	
Without a doubt, Blockchain is a great technology. Its application should not be limited to the
improvement of financial technology, since its irreversible and traceable open records can
make the Blockchain a prudent tool for unpenetrable voting systems and conducting
trustworthy survey results. We will create a coin for the specific purpose of conducting voting
polls and surveys.Our goal in creating Volitium is to allow people to use our platform to
express their will and individual decisions by voting and participating in polls at their
convenient time.
</p><br>
<p class="introText">
The coin will be named “Volitium”. The name “Volitium” originates from the English word
“Volition”, which is defined as one’s power to use their will consisting of connotation of one’s
choice, adding -ium promotes Volitium as an element, symbolizing its metallic properties.
 </p><br>
 <p class="introText">
Blockchain is well known for its irreversible public record and zero double spending. Our
goal is to save cost by removing the middleman through blockchain transactions, by
eliminating the middleman, while maintaining the the authenticity of survey/poll data. With
the implementation of blockchain’s smart contract Volitium ensure transparency,
trustworthiness, and anonymity necessary for surveys, polls, and local voting. With Volitium
as a platform and blockchain as our powerhouse, we will build a voting and survey system
that is safer, more secure, and more trustworthy than ever before . Participants may
voluntarily complete surveys with personal data to receive Volitium as a “tip income” reward
from companies.	 
</p><br>
<p class="introText">
Our target market is companies, individuals, governments, political parties and communities
which conduct surveys, research, or opinion polls for policies or public facilities. When
Volitium system becomes widespread, our ultimate goal is to reform the company and
condominium board voting, community and policy voting, etc. processes to improve
management of policies and public facilities to benefit ordinary people, while mainstreaming
blockchain usage.			
			
		
			</p><br><br>
<span id="currentTag"></span> <br><br><br><br><span class="title">Current Survey/Poll Solution</span>	
<p class="introText">
Whether it is thriving companies or struggling startups, academic researchers or political
entities, there is a demand to conduct surveys or polls for various reason, beit oncoming
committee voting, policy voting, or even condominium landscaping opinions. In the current
market, survey phone calls mainly occur in the evenings or during meals and are perceived
as a disturbance, in addition to the 10 to 15 minutes questionnaires if the call is answered.
Phone calls with pre-recorded voice messages asking opinion polls are likely to be rejected.
A market research survey or opinion poll response rate is only 10% to 15%, which means
making thousands of phone calls to obtain a sample of a few hundred responses.	
</p>
<p class="introText">
There are a few solutions in the market to modify these situations, however, most, if not all,
are flawed. Companies like Gap and Starbucks may request customer feedback through
company websites. In return, survey customers will be rewarded with a discount upon their
next visit in stores, or earn a chance to enter a lucky draw, and even earn a free cup of
coffee at a designated coffee shop. Some limitations would be owing the company’s own
circle of customers.	
</p>
<p class="introText">
Furthermore, there are websites and apps invading people’s online privacy through the use
of cookies and capitalizing the user’s information about their interests, habits and possible
needs. While the number of people expressing their concern for privacy intrusion is
increasing, some aggrieved individuals are already blocking cookies. Users do not like their
online information being shared or viewed by companies unknowingly, as shown in the
recent Facebook data scandal which lead millions of users to deleting their Facebook
accounts..This is becoming a trend. For example, Apple Company’s iOS is providing ad
tracker and ad blocking features that block online tracking, while the co-founder of Russia's
Kaspersky Lab, a Russian online security company, is building smartphones that prevent
apps and websites from stalking users.	
</p>			
<p class="introText">
Companies are purchasing consumer data from social networking sites and technology
giants such as Facebook and Google collected through algorithms engineered to track
users’ interests and tailor advertising content to them.	
</p><br>

<span id="solutionTag"></span> <br><br><br><br><span class="title">Our Solution</span>	
<p class="introText">	
Our solution is to create a network of participants who are willing to answer questionnaires
by using Volitium-based programs. A chosen sample of respondents will receive tokens to
answer the survey. The tokens are used to avoid frauds and duplications. Respondents can
answer questions at their leisure, whether it be riding on a bus or waiting for someone at a
coffee shop. Upon the respondent’s completion of the surveys, they will get paid by their
choice of payment. Users do not need to worry about the complexity of the underlying
blockchain technology. A win-win situation can be achieved as companies can get the
answers they want, while saving costs by simplifying steps to collect genuine information,
and respondents are rewarded, all in a single app.
	
</p>
<p class="introText">	
What gives Volitium its edge, making this decentralized blockchain system superior to
centralized apps? Volitium provides services in two ways. The first is that Volitium is an
uncentralized blockchain that removes the possibility of failure and breach of information that
centralized systems contain. Centralized systems contain a single point of failure when
facing a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks. The decentralized blockchain record
also means that survey and voting results cannot be changed once submitted and therefore
results are much more credible and secure.The smart contract that Volitium creates ensures
that surveyees and voters cast their ballots only once.	
</p><br>
<span id="planTag"></span><br><br><br><br> <span class="title">Plan</span>	
<p class="introText">
In Volitium’s initial stages, our website will be a platform for small investors, startups, small
businesses, student-launched research, market researchers, market participants (who may
want to find out market or economic sentiments), and for those completing surveys for
fun.Through Volitium’s initial stages, user information and opinions will be gathered. This
service will all be free of charge and survey results will be open to the public. Questionnaires
and analytical results will be recorded and available in real time.
</p>
<p class="introText">
Seperate from our free service, larger companies may access a larger survey sample size
with information that caters to their needs, with a small cost. This is the second stage of
Volitium. Companies will buy Volitium to reward respondents. Therefore, companies will
need to budget their survey by estimating rewards for surveyees. The survey results will be
private and owned by companies.
</p>
<p class="introText">
Public opinion polls is another area that blockchain technology can reduce chances of fraud
and allow people to reflect their real opinion. People want to be consulted on policies or
developments that concern their living environment or neighborhood. For example, when a
construction site seeks opinion on whether a building should be torn down, little to no
realistic measures are taken place to inform the local community that they can express their
opinions and concerns. Many people do not pay attention to the minimal advertising set in
place by the construction companies. Moreover, online opinions can be faked for a specific
political purpose, either positively or negatively. Even municipal invitations for a public
consultation meeting at a venue can be easily forgotten if received long before the meeting
date. Our solution suggests that tokens will be sent to affected neighbourhood residents who
already registered their addresses together with their personal identities having shown to the
municipal office, and only those with tokens are endorsed to submit opinions or votes at their
convenience within a time frame. It is foreseen that there would be less forgetful voters and
lesser chance of fake polls.
</p>
<p class="introText">
It is also our plan to crowdfund in creating Volitium coin. However, we will further provide
more information of how and when we will launch our crowdfunding activities later in our blog
and facebook. Meanwhile, we will continue to bring changes in our society through the
implementation of Blockchain technology.
